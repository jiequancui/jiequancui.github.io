I'm currently a Research Fellow at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), working with Prof. Hanwang Zhang.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), supervided by Prof. Jiaya Jia and Prof. Bei Yu in 2022. Before that, I received my B.E. degree from the Computer Science Department of ShanDong University in 2018.



Research
======
#My research aims to build a unified accurate, reliable, robust, and open-world model, which involves several fundamental problems in computer vision and machine learning, such as distribution shifts, adversarial examples, and out-of-distribution generalization.

#Good representation is essential to robustness and generalization. I'm interested in understanding and exploring the nature relations and differences among generative (diffusion models), discriminative, and multi-modal (LLM, VLM) representations.   

Data-centric AI opens the door to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, various data bias, existing in large-scale data, often limits the capabilities of trained models. Removing the data bias can increase the efficiency of training data meanwhile improve model generalization and robustness.
I'm interested in the fundamental research in model generalization and robustness on different data distributions, which involves problems in computer vision and machine learning, such as distribution shifts, adversarial examples, and out-of-distribution generalization.

Understanding the behaviors of large models, like the Stable Diffusion models, LLMs, and VLMs, and their applications in downstream tasks. 
   
I'm glad to touch on new problems related to machine learning, like AI for science, and 3D problems.
