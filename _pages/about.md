I'm a Ph.D. candidate in The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), supervided by Prof. Jiaya Jia. I received my B.E. degree from the computer science department of ShanDong University in 2018.

<font color=red> I am looking for a full-time postdoctoral position. Please feel free to contact me through the email. </font>


Research
======
My research interests include model generalization, robustness, imbalanced learning, and image segmentation.
I'm very glad to touch new problems in computer vision and machine learning.
