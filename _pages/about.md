I'm a Ph.D. candidate in The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), supervided by Prof. Jiaya Jia. I received my B.E. degree from the computer science department of ShanDong University in 2018.



Research
======
My research aims to build a unified accurate, reliable, robust, and open-world model, which involvs several fundamental problems in computer vision and machine learning, such as distribution shifts, adversarial examples, and out-of-distribution generalization.
