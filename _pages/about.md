I am currently a Full Professor at Hefei University of Technology.

I received my Ph.D. degree from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in 2022, under the supervision of Prof. Jiaya Jia and Prof. Bei Yu. Prior to that, I obtained my B.E. degree in Computer Science from Shandong University in 2018. I also spent two wonderful years at Nanyang Technological University.



Research
======
Data-centric AI opens the door to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, data biases inevitably exist in large-scale data, like data imbalance, spurious correlations among classes, and annotation noise. I'm interested in fundamental research of model generalization and robustness on different data distributions, realizing effective usage of large-scale data and that the trained models do not suffer from data biases. It usually involves problems in machine learning and computer vision, like distribution shifts, adversarial robustness, fairness, and out-of-distribution generalization.

Additionally, I aim to understand the behaviors of large models, such as Stable Diffusion models, LLMs, and VLMs, and their applications in downstream tasks.

I am excited to explore new machine learning problems, including AI for science and 3D modeling challenges.
